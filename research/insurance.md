# Minimum Requirements:

1. **Professional indemnity / errors & omissions insurance** (Berufshaftpflicht / Vermögensschadenhaftpflicht) that covers financial loss caused by negligent advice/actions;
2. **General / public liability insurance** (Betriebshaftpflicht) that covers bodily injury and third-party property damage (important for in-person viewings); and
3. **Cyber / Data breach insurance** (recommended) to help cover incident response, notification costs and some liabilities from data breaches (very relevant because you will store IDs/Schufa/POAs).

If you later offer *residential property management* functions, *MaBV §15* requires a professional liability insurance with minimum sums of *€500,000 per claim and €1,000,000 per year* (insurer must be admitted for business in Germany).

## Explanation:

### **Professional indemnity / Vermögensschadenhaftpflicht**

  * Covers claims arising from professional mistakes, negligent advice, incorrect documentation, missed appointments that cause financial loss to a client, bad or misleading information in reports, etc.
  * For a service that advises customers and acts on their behalf, this is core protection. Many insurers offer a tailored product for real-estate brokers / consultants (Vermögensschadenhaftpflicht für Immobilienmakler).
  * €500 – €2,500 / year

### **Betriebshaftpflicht (General liability)**

  * Covers personal injury or property damage that occurs during viewings (e.g., agent trips and injures someone, damages a landlord’s fixture).
  * This is almost always required or strongly recommended when your agents attend properties in person.
  * €150 – €1,000 / year

### **Cyber / Data breach insurance**

  * Your platform will hold very sensitive personal data (IDs, Schufa, salary slips, POAs, videos). Cyber insurance helps with incident response costs, legal defense, notification obligations, and sometimes regulatory fines defense/coverage. (Note: GDPR fines themselves are administrative and may not be insurable in some jurisdictions — check policy terms.)
  *  €300 – €2,000 / year

### **Directors & Officers (D\&O)** (optional early, more relevant as you scale)

  * Protects the company leadership against claims for managerial decisions.

### **Property managers / MaBV-level insurance**

  * If you or your company perform *residential property management* (Wohnimmobilienverwaltung), you must provide the MaBV-style insurance described in §15 MaBV (min. €500k / €1M). Many municipalities and IHKs expect this if you apply for the broader §34c permit and include property management in the scope.
